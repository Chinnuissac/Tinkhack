            </div>
            <div class="tip-item">
                <h3>2. Moisturize Daily</h3>

                <h3>3. Gentle Cleansing</h3>
                <p>Opt for mild, fragrance-free cleansers to avoid irritating your skin. This is important if you're dealing with postpartum hormonal changes.</p>

            <div class="tip-item">
                <h3>1. Consult Your Doctor</h3>
                <p>Always get clearance from your healthcare provider before starting any exercise program, especially after a C-section or if you experienced complications during delivery.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-item">
                <h3>2. Listen to Your Body</h3>
                <p>Start slowly and pay attention to how your body responds. Stop any exercise that causes pain or discomfort.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tip-item">
                <h3>3. Focus on Core and Pelvic Floor</h3>
                <p>Strengthening these areas is crucial for recovery and overall stability.</p>
            </div>

        <!-- Exercises After C-Section Section -->
        <div class="tips-section">
            <h2>Exercises After C-Section</h2>
            <h3>Breathing Exercises</h3>
            <p><strong>Diaphragmatic Breathing:</strong> Sit comfortably, place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly. Inhale deeply through your nose, allowing your belly to rise more than your chest. Exhale slowly. This helps strengthen the core and promote relaxation.</p>

            <h3>Pelvic Floor Exercises (Kegels)</h3>
            <p><strong>Identify pelvic floor muscles:</strong> Contract and hold for five seconds; repeat 10 times throughout the day to strengthen these muscles.</p>

            <h3>Pelvic Tilts</h3>
            <p><strong>Pelvic Tilts:</strong> Lie on your back with knees bent. Tilt your hips toward your upper body, engaging your core as you raise your buttocks slightly off the floor. Hold for a few seconds and repeat 10 times.</p>

            <h3>Wall Sits</h3>
            <p><strong>Wall Sits:</strong> Stand with your back against a wall, slide down into a sitting position with knees bent at 90 degrees, and hold for as long as comfortable. This strengthens the legs and engages the core.</p>

            <h3>Glute Bridges</h3>
            <p><strong>Glute Bridges:</strong> Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Push through your heels to lift your hips off the ground, squeezing glutes at the top. Hold for a few seconds before lowering down; repeat 10-15 times.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Exercises After Normal Delivery Section -->
        <div class="tips-section">
            <h2>Exercises After Normal Delivery</h2>
            <h3>Walking</h3>
            <p>Start with short walks (10-15 minutes) and gradually increase duration as you feel comfortable. Walking is an excellent low-impact exercise that aids recovery.</p>

            <h3>Modified Side Plank</h3>
            <p>Lie on your side with knees bent, lift your body into a plank position while keeping knees on the ground. This engages core muscles without excessive strain.</p>

            <h3>Knee Rolling</h3>
            <p>While sitting, keep knees together and gently roll them side to side within comfort limits to promote mobility in the lower back.</p>

            <h3>Seated Forward Bend</h3>
            <p>Sit with legs extended, reach forward towards your toes while keeping the spine straight to stretch the back and hamstrings gently.</p>

            <h3>Swimming or Water Aerobics</h3>
            <p>Once cleared by a doctor, swimming can be an excellent way to engage in full-body exercise without impact on joints.</p>

            <h2>When to Progress</h2>
            <h3>Initial Phase (First 6 Weeks)</h3>
            <p>Focus on gentle movements like walking, breathing exercises, and pelvic floor strengthening.</p>

            <h3>Post 6 Weeks</h3>
            <p>Gradually introduce more structured workouts including strength training and aerobic exercises as recommended by your healthcare provider.</p>
